KeepAlive - Keep Alive is a periodic liveness-detection mechanism in which one endpoint sends heartbeat messages at fixed intervals to verify that a peer,
connection, or service is still operational. Failure to receive heartbeats within a defined timeout triggers failure handling logic (e.g., connection teardown,
role change, or failover).

VRRP - VRRP is a network-layer redundancy protocol that allows multiple routers or hosts to share a single virtual IP address (VIP) and guarantees that exactly one node owns 
it at any time. Its purpose is fast, deterministic failover of an IP endpoint.(virtual router redundancy protocol)

VIP (Virtual IP)
A VIP (Virtual IP address) is an IP address that is not permanently bound to a single physical or virtual network interface, but can be dynamically assigned and
reassigned between multiple nodes.
